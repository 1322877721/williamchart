# williamchart ![phone][7]![watch][8]

Williamchart is an Android Library to rapidly implement good looking charts in android applications.

Note: WilliamChart v3 has been completely re-written from scratch in Kotlin and does not guarantee any API and features compatibility with previous versions. Android development has been evolving quickly, and much has changed since I first started developing williamchart (e.g patterns, testing, tools), so I decided it was a good time to get a completely fresh version with all these new things in mind. I intend to keep it as light and modular as possible.

So far it gives you:

* Line charts
* Bar charts
* Horizontal bar charts

Tested in Android XXX and above.

And here is the [javadoc][6].

### Gradle 
``` groovy
   implementation 'com.diogobernardino:williamchart:3.0.0-beta1'
```
