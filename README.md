# williamchart ![phone][2]![watch][3]

Williamchart is an Android Library to rapidly implement attractive and insightful charts in android applications.

Note: WilliamChart v3 has been completely re-written from scratch in Kotlin and does not guarantee any API/features compatibility with previous versions. Android development has been evolving quickly, and much has changed since I first started developing williamchart (e.g patterns, testing, tools), so I decided it was time to rewrite it with all these new tools in mind. I intend to keep it as light and modular as possible.

### Gradle 
``` groovy
implementation 'com.diogobernardino:williamchart:3.0'
```

If you find this library useful and decide to use it in your projects please drop me a line [@dfbernardino][1], I will be happy to know about it.
